This project is a result of an assessment exercise from Car Next Door AUS. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Process of project creation is as follows: 
- UI/UX Sketch with reference to wireframes
- Created initial project using Angular 9 thru Angular CLI
- Read about Angular 9 (I am adept to using React.js but I initiated to try doing the assessment on Angular, since it is the company's tech stack)
- Followed the assessment's instructions and created this project as a result. 


## Tech Stack:
- Angular v.9.0.5
- RxJS
- Angular Material (UI Components)
- Augury (For develop purposes)
- SCSS (CSS pre-processor) 
- TypeScript (Added typings for Google Maps)

## API used: 
- Google Maps API 
- http://cndlunarlocator.herokuapp.com/vehicles/0/locate.json (Given API for lunar locator) 

## Tools: 
- Procreate (For CND Logo re-vamp to Rover Next Door)
